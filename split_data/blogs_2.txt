Come join us next Tuesday February 21 st for discussion on Chapter 3. We will talk about personal will, self control and the ability to stay true to ourselves as we travel through this life. The gathering is fun, free and another opportunity to meet new people.
Complaining and repeating everything we already know every day will do you no good if you do not even have a dog as an early warning system or you allow your daughters to go gallivanting in the streets at night.

Smokers I have little sympathy for – you made that decision, in the face of all the evidence that it’s not just seriously harmful to you, but to everyone around you, so I’m sorry, but you get to live with the consequences. And had I not lived, worked and socialised among smokers for most of my life, until the ban, I wouldn’t be anywhere near as ill as I am now, so sympathy is in very short supply.
- Food and drink disliking. I’m not really sure what the correct term is for this, but I developed a dislike for almost all of the foods that I once liked, and couldn’t drink fizzy pop at all! I think I may have literally lived on pickled onion space raiders and fruit juice for the entire first trimester…and possibly a lot of the second.
So our prayer for today goes like this:

I'm a voracious reader. Always have been. As a teenager, my parents ended up having to hide my books so I would get my chores done because I would spend every chance I got reading. It didn't really change when I had a family, except no one had to hide my books so I'd get my chores done. :P

As a result, it was immensely refreshing for me to read the below article by Aadil Palkhivala, an Ayurvedic practitioner who is widely regarded as one of the world’s top yoga teachers. Things that particularly resonated with me are his simple yet powerful statements like ‘There is no perfect diet, and no ideal food. I encourage you to monitor your food intake to determine what works for you and what doesn’t—diet has to be adjusted individually’. Good common sense in many respects, and principles that are easy to follow and live by. I look forward to reading much more from this wise man!
